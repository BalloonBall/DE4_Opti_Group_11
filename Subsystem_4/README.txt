Subsystem_4:Profit
=======

*Maximising profit by choosing material and change manufacture setting*


Main script 
-------
The GA_Cost.m and fminco_Cost.m MATLAB script should be run.
The visualisation.m MATLAB script would provide all the figures appeared in the report.

In GA_Cost.m, 'bestx' gives the best option for variables to reach highest profit 'bestProfit'
In fminco_Cost.m,  'xbest ' gives the best option for variables to reach highest profit 'fval'


Please make sure the datafiles:material_liner.csv, manufacture_data.csv and ProductionData.csv are in the same directory with the main script.


Execution time
-------

- 8 seconds for Genetic Algorithm
- 0.9824 seconds for fmincon method.

Dependencies
-------
The script requires:
- MATLAB_R2019b
- MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox
