This is the README for the Subsystem_1: Comfort
=======

This subsystem aims to optimise the comfort of a bicycle helmet by maximising heat transfer and minimising weight.

The 'singleobjective.m' script contains an exploration of the problem space, as well as four different fmincon algorithms used to compare the results and optima for heat transfer.

The 'multiobjective.m' script uses a genetic algorithm and various weightings between the heat transfer and mass objectives.

The variable results are displayed in the command window when the scripts are run.


Main script 
-------
The 'singleobjective.m' and 'multiobjective.m' MATLAB scripts should be run from the same directory. Please note that output values may differ to those in the report.


Execution time
-------
The execution time is approximately 3.615 seconds for the 'singleobjective.m' script, and XX seconds for the 'multiobjective.m' script.


Dependencies
-------
The scripts require MATLAB R2018b and the Global Optimisation Toolbox to be installed.
